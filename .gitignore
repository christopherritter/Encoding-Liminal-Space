# If you want to ignore a whole directory at repo root, use a leading slash
# /secrets/

# Notes:
# - .gitignore prevents untracked files from being added to the repo.
# - If a file is already tracked (already committed), you must remove it from the index
#   with `git rm --cached` (see below) before it will be ignored.
